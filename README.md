# Online_Retail_Store_Analysis
This project involves conducting an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of online retail sales using Python and Pandas. The main goal of this project is to identify trends and patterns in customer behavior that can be used to inform marketing and sales strategies.

Project Overview
The project involves the following steps:

1. Data loading and preprocessing: The data is loaded from a CSV file and preprocessed to clean and transform the data as needed.

2. Exploratory data analysis: Various data visualization techniques are used to explore the data and identify any patterns or trends.

3. K-means clustering: The K-means clustering algorithm is used to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

4. Association rule mining: The Apriori algorithm is used to identify frequent itemsets and rules between product categories.

5. RFM analysis: The Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) analysis is used to identify high-value customers.

6. Data visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries are used to create various data visualizations to effectively communicate insights to stakeholders and team members.
